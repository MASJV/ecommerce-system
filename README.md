## üìù Project Overview

A robust **backend system** for e-commerce, enabling the management of products, users, reviews, shopping carts, and orders.

- RESTful APIs built with Spring Boot and standard Java.
- Designed for educational, demonstration, or prototyping contexts‚Äîusing in-memory lists for data storage.
- Clean separation of controllers, services, repositories, and DTOs.
- Carefully structured business rules: stock checks, review restrictions, cart logic.

## üíª Technology Stack

- **Java 17+**
- **Spring Boot**
- **Lombok**
- **Maven/Gradle**
- **Postman** (for API testing)

## üöÄ Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**
    ```
   git clone https://github.com/MASJV/ecommerce-system.git
   cd ecommerce-system
   ```

2. **Verify Java and build tool versions**
    ```
   java -version
   mvn -v # or gradle -v
   ```


3. **Build the project**
- Maven:
  ```
  mvn clean install
  ```
- Gradle:
  ```
  ./gradlew build
  ```

4. **Run the application**
- Maven:
  ```
  mvn spring-boot:run
  ```
- Or just run the main class from your IDE.

5. **Access REST APIs**
- Base URL: `http://localhost:8081/api/v1/`

## ‚öôÔ∏è Features & Backend Logic

- **Product Management:** CRUD operations, live average ratings, stock update on orders.
- **User Management:** CRUD operations, personal cart and order history.
- **Cart & Order Logic:** Add/remove products, validate stock and quantities, place orders.
- **Reviews:** Only ordered products can be reviewed, one review per product per user; removing/adding reviews updates average product rating.
- **Robust Exception Handling:** Custom exceptions clarify invalid operations or missing data.

## üîÆ Future Enhancements

This project provides a strong foundation, and here are some valuable features and improvements planned for future versions:

- **Authentication & Authorization:**  
  Implement user login, JWT or OAuth2 security, roles, and permissions for protected endpoints.

- **Persistent Storage:**  
  Replace in-memory lists with a database such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for data persistence and scalability.
